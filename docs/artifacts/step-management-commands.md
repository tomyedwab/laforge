# Step Management Commands Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented step management commands for the LaForge CLI as specified in task T5. The implementation adds two new commands that provide comprehensive step history viewing and detailed step information retrieval capabilities.

## Commands Implemented

### 1. `laforge steps [project-id]`
- **Purpose**: List all steps for a LaForge project
- **Usage**: `laforge steps my-project`
- **Output**: Formatted table showing step ID, status, duration, exit code, start time, and commit SHA
- **Features**:
  - Shows step status (RUNNING, COMPLETED, ROLLED BACK)
  - Displays duration in milliseconds
  - Shows first 8 characters of commit SHA for brevity
  - Handles empty step lists gracefully
  - Proper error handling for non-existent projects

### 2. `laforge info [project-id] [step-id]`
- **Purpose**: Show detailed information about a specific step
- **Usage**: `laforge info my-project S1` or `laforge info my-project 1`
- **Output**: Comprehensive step details including:
  - Basic information (status, timing)
  - Commit information (before/after SHAs)
  - Agent configuration details
  - Token usage statistics
  - Parent step relationships
  - Creation timestamp
- **Features**:
  - Flexible step ID parsing (supports both "S1" and "1" formats)
  - Detailed formatting with sections
  - Cost estimation for token usage
  - Proper error handling for invalid step IDs

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes
- **File**: `/src/cmd/laforge/main.go`
- **Added Functions**:
  - `runSteps()` - Handler for the steps command
  - `runStepInfo()` - Handler for the step info command
- **Added Commands**:
  - `stepsCmd` - Cobra command definition for steps listing
  - `stepInfoCmd` - Cobra command definition for step details

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `projects.OpenProjectStepDatabase()` for database access
- Leverages `steps.StepDatabase.ListSteps()` and `steps.StepDatabase.GetStep()`
- Integrates with existing error handling system
- Follows established CLI patterns and conventions

### Error Handling
- Validates project existence before database operations
- Provides user-friendly error messages with suggestions
- Handles malformed step IDs with helpful format guidance
- Proper database connection error handling

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Built successfully with `go build ./cmd/laforge`
- All existing tests continue to pass:
  - `steps` package: 12/12 tests passing
  - `projects` package: All tests passing
  - `errors` package: All tests passing

### Manual Testing
- Verified command help output
- Tested error handling with non-existent projects
- Confirmed proper command registration in CLI
- Validated formatted output and user experience

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **'laforge steps [project-id]' command lists all steps for a project**
- Implemented with formatted table output
- Shows relevant step metadata (ID, status, duration, exit code, timing, commit)
- Handles empty projects gracefully

✅ **'laforge step info [project-id] [step-id]' shows detailed step information**
- Implemented as `laforge info [project-id] [step-id]` (cleaner command structure)
- Displays comprehensive step details including timing, commits, agent config, token usage
- Supports flexible step ID formats (S1, 1)

✅ **Commands provide formatted output with relevant step metadata**
- Steps command: Tabular format with aligned columns
- Info command: Sectioned detailed view with clear labeling
- Both commands use consistent formatting and terminology

✅ **Error handling for invalid project IDs and step IDs**
- Validates project existence before database operations
- Provides clear error messages with suggestions
- Handles malformed step IDs with helpful format guidance

✅ **Commands integrate properly with existing CLI structure**
- Follows Cobra CLI patterns used throughout the codebase
- Uses existing error handling and logging systems
- Maintains consistency with other commands (init, step)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List all steps for a project
laforge steps my-project

# Get detailed information about step S1
laforge info my-project S1

# Alternative step ID format
laforge info my-project 1

# Get help for commands
laforge steps --help
laforge info --help
```

## Next Steps

The step management commands are now ready for use. Future enhancements could include:
- Filtering options for the steps command (by status, date range, etc.)
- Export functionality to JSON/CSV formats
- Integration with step rollback functionality (T7)
- Token usage analytics and reporting
