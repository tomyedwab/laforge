# Web UI Polish and Final Testing Plan

## Current State Analysis

The LaForge web UI is built with Preact and TypeScript and includes:
- Basic task management interface
- Step history visualization  
- Review workflow
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Responsive design foundation
- Basic authentication

## Areas Identified for Polish

### 1. Responsive Design Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- Mobile navigation could be improved
- Touch targets need optimization
- Layout breaks on very small screens
- No mobile-specific interactions

**Improvements Needed:**
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Add hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- Optimize touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Improve mobile form layouts
- Add swipe gestures for task interactions

### 2. Accessibility (A11y) Enhancements
**Current Issues:**
- Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- No keyboard navigation support
- Poor focus management
- No screen reader optimizations

**Improvements Needed:**
- Add comprehensive ARIA labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add focus indicators and management
- Ensure color contrast compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Add skip navigation links
- Implement proper heading hierarchy

### 3. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features
**Current Issues:**
- No offline support
- No service worker
- No web app manifest
- No install prompt

**Improvements Needed:**
- Create web app manifest
- Implement service worker for offline support
- Add caching strategies
- Implement install prompt
- Add app icons and splash screens

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Current Issues:**
- No code splitting
- No lazy loading
- Large bundle size
- No performance monitoring

**Improvements Needed:**
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Add component lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement image optimization

### 5. Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Current Issues:**
- CSS features may not work in older browsers
- No polyfills for modern JavaScript features
- No browser-specific testing

**Improvements Needed:**
- Add CSS autoprefixing
- Include necessary polyfills
- Test across major browsers
- Add fallbacks for modern features

### 6. User Experience (UX) Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- Basic loading states
- Limited error handling
- No confirmation dialogs
- No toast notifications

**Improvements Needed:**
- Enhanced loading states with skeleton screens
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Implement toast notification system
- Add progress indicators for long operations

### 7. Testing Coverage
**Current Issues:**
- Outdated test files
- Low test coverage
- No integration tests
- No accessibility tests

**Improvements Needed:**
- Update existing tests to match current implementation
- Add comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage)
- Implement integration tests
- Add accessibility testing
- Add visual regression testing
